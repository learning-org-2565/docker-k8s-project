  # "When I see CrashLoopBackOff, I run kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous to check the crashed container's logs. 
  #In this example, the logs showed 'Simulating crash' which indicates the application is exiting with an error code.
  # CrashLoopBackOff means the container successfully starts but the application inside crashes immediately, then Kubernetes keeps restarting it in an exponential backoff pattern. 
  #Common causes are missing environment variables, database connection failures, or application code bugs."

#   ImagePullBackOff:
#   ❌ Container NEVER starts
#   → Image doesn't exist
#   → Check: kubectl describe (Events shows image pull error)

# CrashLoopBackOff:
#   ✅ Container DOES start
#   ❌ Application crashes
#   → Check: kubectl logs --previous (see why app crashed)
